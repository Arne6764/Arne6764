-  Hi, I’m Arne6764
-  Pronouns: She/Her
-  I’m an Unity game developer with a focus on high fantasy, strategy, and RPG elements.
-  I'm also a web developer (PHP), although only one of my websites has actually had any use, with that being for a school project
-  Current Project(s): C++ ASCII Roguelike - Full Open Source

I am a solo dev, I am not currently willing to join any development groups or companies. All work given to others will either be for friends or for open source linux projects. Sorry for any inconvenience.
I will also not provide contact info for privacy reasons.
